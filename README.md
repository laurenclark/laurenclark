### Hi there 👋 

I'm a front-end focused developer who specialises in JavaScript. I have over 8 years experience creating and optimising web UI's, apps and deliverables. I mainly work with __React__ and __Vue__, JAMstack, and headless software in the web.


__Things I've Worked On:__

🏦 - Lead Fintech MVP Front End creation for an Identification app (Used by Natwest, BetFred and Vanquis) 

🧑‍🎨 - SME Design Consultancies and built ✨beautiful✨ web applications for brands and orgs like LVMH and Gov.uk

🛒 - Created and contributed to lots of different eCommerce applications such as Solopress, Total Fishing Tackle and 🍸 Craft Gin Club

__Things I Want to Work On:__

Web applications which are altruistic in their nature and backed by a passionate, honest team who accept each others strengths and weakness, and who prefer to think for themselves and not follow fads. I want to help solve real world problems -- faced by everyday people, and I want to do it with a tech stack that has great defaults. A tech stack which is as decouplable, delcarative, and easy to work with as possible. It's my experience that tech like that allows a team to create freely and happily, whilst avoiding pitfalls and bugs. 


__Where I Work Well:__

In remote-first autonomous teams where I can learn, and teach new things! I like a diverse range of people, from different places and cultures, and I enjoy the abstract thinking which that can ignite. I work well in product teams where I can focus and create, iteratively. I seek out management and colleagues that coach, mentor and collaborate with empathy.


__Hobbies:__

I play 🎸 guitar, bass, mandolin and harmonica. I like to cook (mostly Mediterranean and Asian cuisine). I have a 🐈 and I like to take long walks on the beach and in the woods. Thats only when I can get tear myself away from coding and video games 👻!. Currently I'm learning TypeScript and 日本語 🇯🇵 (Japanese is easier 🤯) When I grow up I want to write books and work 3 days a week.

__Likes:__

- 🟨 JAVASCRIPT (it's not weird, just misunderstood 💔)
- People with interesting stories 
- Cats (dogs too, but _cats_)
- Dumplings 🥟
- Spending 2 hours automating something to save myself half an hour
- Stoicism
- Secure people who encourage and motivate
- Yak shaving and tinkering with some library/pattern/nonsense I will never use in prod
- The color red 🟥

__Dislikes:__

- Too much social media
- Tumultuousness
- People who talk a lot but don't say anything 
- Evil AI 🤖👿
- Censorship and cult thinking
- Insecurity manifesting in egos, nitpicking and micromanagement 😡
- Zippy from Rainbow
